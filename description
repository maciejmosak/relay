This project is made to control power distribution for 3D-printers cluster (but of course may be used for powering any 12V devices). 
 
First, beta version will be Arduino UNO board controlled from PC by USB. We have there 6 analog pins to use (ADC), so I decided to divide input power to 5 output ports - I will measure voltage at input, and 5 currents for every output.

Switching power will be done by five, 16A (or 25A) relays, current measurement will be done by 1mOhm resistor and MCP6N11-100E/SN amplifier (which will give me 0,1V gain for every 1A).
