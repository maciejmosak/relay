	This project is made to control power distribution for 3D-printers cluster (but of course may be used for powering any 12V devices). 
 
	First, beta version will be Arduino UNO board controlled from PC by USB. 

	We have there 6 analog pins to use (ADC), so I decided to divide input power to 5 output ports - I will measure voltage at input, and 5 currents for every output. (But firstly I will just use digital pins to provide any feedback, so I'll have just window with 5 buttons and 5 indicators (red/green light))

	Switching power will be done by five, 16A (or 25A) relays, current measurement will be done by 1mOhm resistor and MCP6N11-100E/SN amplifier (which will give me 0,1V gain for every 1A).
	
	There gonna be one class for relays (binary state, binary feedback, double current) and second class for input (binary feedback, double voltage).
